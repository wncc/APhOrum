\emph{Nandu} is hovering in orbit around the remote desert planet of \emph{Runeterra}. His despair came to an end when he saw his lover \emph{Nandini} in the same orbit in perfect conjunction with Runeterra. Without any ado, he prepares his jets to reach her when he notices one of Shrapnel's shooter bots continuously firing bullets in all directions. The velocity of the bullets is such that they closely miss hitting the lovers (when they are at their initial positions). Help him find a trajectory towards his lover such that the bullets can't reach him. The shooter is fixed at a position in space initially midway between Nandu and the planet.
